        <p  class="extra-padding">Car has become the most significant medium of transportation in these years. In last five years, there was an exponential increment in sells of new car. According to numbers, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/india-pips-germany-ranks-4th-largest-auto-market-now/articleshow/63438236.cms"> India is now 4th biggest car market in world.</a></p>

         <p  class="extra-padding">As we know car are being smarter than before. It has auto-lock facility, Air bags and many more. But people avoid these features and buy base model of car because it is chipper. In rural area, Mostly, people buy these vehicle as they face difficulty to adopt technology because it made like that. It is not indigenously developed.</p>
	
         <p  class="extra-padding">This journey start with a news article about a kid die in a car while playing around it, in Delhi. I started researching about it. I found around 300 kids die in car in last 10 years at USA. It was horrifying news for me. I found few cases in India, from newspapers but most of the cases where undocumented.</p>
	
         <p  class="extra-padding">It was a hypothesis that if we buy these many cars in India, it may cross this number in few years. I wanted to work on these. I started research around these data. There is multiple use case I found, where car technology is still limited. It is related to person’s life, security of car and enhancement of car technology. Please have a look on small fractioned use cases which are borrowed from my primary research (name and location are changed for personal security reason).<br> Primary research involves 35 car users (urban, semi-urban), 8 cab drivers, 4 single-mothers.</p>
