          <p class="extra-padding">If you ask any space traveller about gravity, he/she might reply, ‘It is as important as oxygen in
        air.’ Gravity is the weakest force among all 4 natural forces. You overcome gravity by a jump. It is not just sticking us on the earth only. It is beyond earth. The whole solar system is tied by gravity, beyond that Galaxies are formation, Black hole. In all, gravity plays a huge role. Even though, it is the weakest force.</p>

        <p class="extra-padding">Almost 100 years ago, in 1916, Albert Einstein come up with explanation of ‘Gravitational wave’
     based on his general theory of relativity. It says, ‘Gravitational waves are 'ripples' in the fabric of space-time caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe’ [ref: https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw ]</p>
        
      <p class="extra-padding">Let me put this in simple words, Space-time is an imaginary fabric of infinite length and width is
  spread like carpet in the space on which all the planet and stars and all the astronomical objects rest. So, like any fabric if anything stays on a fabric it creates a dent. The heavier object, bigger the dent. And that’s how they roam around the space-time. Interesting, right?</p>
        
           <p class="extra-padding">Things like exploding stars and collisions between ultra-dense neutron stars or merging black
holes creates disturbance on this fabric. As we know if suddenly something falls over a hanging cloth it generates vibration ripples which goes all ends of the fabric with enough amplitude as impactful it is. Same way, on this kind of special events in space it creates a ripple which flows all around the universe and gives a motion to all the objects laying over it.</p>
        
           <p class="extra-padding">Then, why we never feel any jerk when it happens? Because when it moves earth, we are also
moving with it because there is no change in relativity of earth and us. We become part of its motion when it comes to us. Such a beautiful phenomenon!!</p>
        
           <p class="extra-padding">This extraordinary theory is beyond our thinking and more philosophical. On the 101 st
anniversary of this theory, I wanted to give a tribute to this theory. I was in my first year at that time in National Institute of Design, India. In my programme New Media Design, we have a module for ‘Kinetic Sculpture’ and the statement was to make it wind-driven. I proposed this idea to give a tribute on the 101 th anniversary of this theory to my course coordinator and he liked the idea and I started conceptualizing around.</p>
        
         <p class="extra-padding">So, First I wanted to keep it abstract, but I should have that beauty as the theory has. It is also
delicate, and it has variation in its amplitude. To keep it on the sculpture, I tried multiple material and experiments on scientific phenomenon. After many interaction, I come up with an idea to keep magnetism as a representation of gravity. Both are primary natural forces and their behaviour is also similar. Both attracts towards it as per their weight and material capability.</p>
        
         <p class="extra-padding">This is a state of art design which is stands on a single point without any support which is
describes its delicacy. And it's precious calculation which allows it to stand suggests the universe is so accurate in every terms. All planets are proportional to each other and they move without any delay or jigs, precise for billions of years. And the shape suggests the range of it. It is the smallest and it has the largest amplitude.</p>
