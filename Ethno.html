          <p class="extra-padding">My ethnography social group was a farmer family. They live on a chikoo (<l>Manilkara zapota</l>) farm near Vadsar village, Ahmedabad. The family has 4 people. Head of the family and his wife. One son and his wife. Their job is to keep farm healthy and in the season of chikoo. The farm is owned by the different person. They kept this family to live there and take care of this land.</p>

        <p class="extra-padding">I spend 10 days and generated personal observation report of 114 pages. From the PO, I found they have a unique thing which ties them together even though there are many consequences and clashes between father and son. Everyone in the family has 'Badha' (Gujarati word, meaning a promise to god which is fulfilled when God fulfills their expectation.) Everyone in the family has it. They insisted me to be part of that ritual to fulfill wishes if I have.  </p>

         <p class="extra-padding">The question for this course was to find significant sound to this social group. There was really big silence between the family member but according to research I found, the sound of inside urge for their wishes to be fulfilled is more significant to them although it is just metaphor sound. </p>

         <p class="extra-padding">As an artifact to represent my research, I made a ladder made up from the 'mauli'. Mauli is a spiritual thread which used by pandit. They tied it to person's wrist as a blessing to get through something or as a hope to give confidence to a person. They kept 'Badha' to get out from the situation and move upward in the society or from the problem. The ladder has the same feeling to get away to reach the destination (Something like Jacob's ladder described in western mythology).  But this ladder is made up from the mauli which is a really weak thread and there is no chance to reach the upper level. Faith is the thing where you cant find guarantee but it's all on the person.</p>
