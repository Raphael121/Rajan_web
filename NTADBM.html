          <p class="extra-padding">In the current scenario, digital payment system between vendors and consumers already exists like Paytm & BHIM but this kind of system does not exist between merchants and vendors. Transaction of money between merchants and vendors currently happens via cheque or credit. Having such a system will help in the easy transaction of money and vendors will no longer have to keep a record of accounting transactions. It will also help in driving the cashless/paperless economy.</p>

        <p class="extra-padding">Based on the field research conducted, it was found that both the lenders and borrowers were facing difficulties in managing the credit. Borrowers and lenders needed options for bank accounts, facilities to create standing instructions. Lenders needed a credit scoring system to give them a comprehensive scene of the borrowers. Merchants/retailers needed a one-stop solution with respect to an accounting of transactions that the buyers involved with the store. This helps in accurate predictions for their credit borrowing purposes.The merchants needed a better understanding of customers, their needs and transaction details at a single place for them to evaluate for advertising opportunities.</p>

        <p class="extra-padding"><img src="images/portfolio/NTADBMApp.jpg"></p>

        <p class="extra-padding">Revenue generation is through the following ways:

        </p>
         <p class="extra-padding">
          <b>Charging the money lenders:</b>
The application will help money/credit gives the feature to pick and choose the borrower for their needs. A list of available borrowers and their credit rating and analysis will be provided in the application for the credit providers. Thus a commission will be charged from the money lenders for providing this wholesome service to them, every time they lend, with respect to the relative transaction amount and the buyer's credit rating.

        </p>
         <p class="extra-padding">
         <b> Charging the advertisers:</b>

         The advertisers will be provided with extensive information and advanced technologies to help them target the right customer at the right time. Location-based and customer-centric targeted advertising is providing the advertisers with very relevant data for them to work with. Thus, charging the advertisers for each advertisement placed on the buyer’s mobile application is the other source of revenue. Advertisements on the App will be shown in different places on the page and will be charged accordingly based on their relative scale, size and popularity. For instance, in the sample UI above, there are two Advertisements. The Zomato Ad is at the top center, and hence will be more prominently seen. Thus, this can be charged higher when compared to the Big Basket Ad.

          </p>

          <p class="extra-padding"><b>Scheduled Payment</b> is generally done by cheques. PayTM and other Paying wallets don’t offer this option which is required by the seller. which has specific order every month and the payment amount is almost same. But checking for the status of the transaction periodically is an added burden for the sellers. To reduce the workload and increase the efficiency, we are introducing this feature.
          </p>

          <p class="extra-padding"><b>For advertising,</b>we connect merchant to the ad agency who will take care of designing. The ad agency will be provided with an option to upload it on BHIM app on the user side, according to their need and requirement. On BHIM app, they can monitor the data generation and their target audience. Through analyzing rich data, they can plan their budget and frequency of advertising better. Also, they can use their credit value as a currency to sell their ads.
